# üß¨ ChemMiniQ3-SAbRLo (Synthetic Accessibility with Bioaware RL ‚Äî Optimized)

ChemMiniQ3-SAbRLo is a lightweight experimental generative model for chemistry, built on mini **Qwen3**, designed for **rapid prototyping of HuggingFace `AutoModel` and `AutoTokenizer` compatibility**, and **fast iteration of Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) and RL fine-tuning algorithms/rewards**.

It introduces a **new reinforcement learning framework** as the next iteration of [ChemMiniQ3-HoriFIE](https://huggingface.co/gbyuvd/ChemMiniQ3-HoriFIE), combining:

- üß© **Synthetic Accessibility (SA) Rewards** ‚Äî guiding generation with a classifier (`gbyuvd/synthaccess-chemselfies`) to favor molecules that are easier to synthesize.  
- üîÑ **Cyclical Gradual Generation** ‚Äî a curriculum learning strategy that **gradually increases molecule length up to 25 tokens**, then **resets and repeats**, enabling faster RL convergence and stable prototyping.

The model can be trained on a laptop with only 2GB VRAM (NVIDIA 930M in my case), for NTP+MTP it took ~2h:40m per chunk and for RL it took ~45m for 4500 steps;

Example of a generated molecule, found no identical mol in PubChem

# üß™ Reinforcement Learning Enhancements

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ SA-Guided PPO-KL Fine-Tuning
- Uses `gbyuvd/synthaccess-chemselfies` as a **reward model**  
- Rewards molecules predicted as **"Easy"** to synthesize  
- Penalizes molecules predicted as **"Hard"**  
- Designed for **rapid reward ablation**: SA-only, ChemQ3-only, or mixed modes  
- Tries to be compatible with HuggingFace `Trainer` and `PPOTrainer` for easy RL experimentation  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Symmetric Curriculum with Normalized Rewards
- Generation length increases and decreases smoothly: **10 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 25 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 10 ‚Ä¶**  
- Avoids sharp resets by cycling symmetrically instead of jumping from max back to min  
- **[Previous cyclical approach - now enhanced]**: Gradually increases max generation length, but now uses **symmetric cycling** to avoid sharp transitions  
- Rewards are normalized by sequence length (default: ‚àölen) to stabilize training across different rollout sizes  
- KL and entropy controllers are reset and recalibrated at each curriculum phase change  
- Entropy targets scale with sequence length, encouraging consistent exploration at both short and long contexts  
- Why **25**? Because **faster RL training requires shorter sequences** to enable rapid iteration ‚Äî 25 tokens potentially could strike the optimal balance between structural complexity and training speed, allowing 2‚Äì3x more gradient steps per epoch compared to 30+ token sequences  

> üí° *Note: The average SELFIES sequence length in our ~3M dataset is 33.41 ¬± 1.80 tokens ‚Äî but for RL prototyping, we cap at 25 to accelerate training cycles and improve signal-to-noise in reward gradients.*

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ PPO, KL, and Entropy Stabilization
- **PPO loss** uses advantage clipping scaled with sequence length to prevent gradient spikes  
- **KL controller** adapts Œ≤ more quickly and resets per curriculum update  
- **Entropy controller** adjusts targets based on sequence length to balance exploration

## üöÄ Why ChemMiniQ3-SAbRLo?
- Prior approaches optimized only validity or physicochemical rules (Lipinski, etc.)  
- **Our method explicitly biases generation toward molecules that are not just valid, but also *easier to synthesize***  
- Extends beyond validity and rule-based rewards by explicitly biasing toward **synthetically accessible molecules**  
- The **symmetric curriculum + reward normalization** improves stability across varying sequence lengths  
- The **cyclical gradual curriculum + 25-token cap** potentially keeps training dynamic, avoids overfitting, and enables **<1hr RL policy iterations** on a single GPU  
- Shorter capped lengths (‚â§25 tokens) allow faster iteration, enabling more frequent updates and practical RL prototyping  
- Built from the ground up for (at least try to) **HuggingFace AutoModel/AutoTokenizer compatibility**
---

> üí° **Target domain:** molecular generation (SELFIES).  
> üî¨ **Goal:** molecules that are valid, bioaware, and synthetically accessible.  
> üöÄ **Core innovation:** fast, modular prototyping of **MTP + RL fine-tuning pipelines** using standard HuggingFace components.
